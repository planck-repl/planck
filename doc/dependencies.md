## Dependencies

<img width="100" align="right" style="margin: 0ex 1em" src="img/dependencies.jpg">

Source executed via Planck can depend on other bootstrapped-compatible libraries. To do so, the library must be on Planck's classpath, available either as source on an accessible filesystem, or bundled in a JAR.

> Planck can consume conventional JARs meant for use with ClojureScript obtained from [Clojars](https://clojars.org) or elsewhere.

Note that, since Planck employs _bootstrapped_ ClojureScript, not all regular ClojureScript libraries will work with Planck. In particular, libraries that employ macros that either rely on Java interop, or call macros in the same _compilation stage_ cannot work.  But libraries that employ straightforward macros that expand to ClojureScript work fine.

### Using deps.edn

If you use the `plk` script (instead of launching `planck` directly), it will delegate to the [`clojure`](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_clojure_installer_and_cli_tools) tool for dependency management. This means you can use `deps.edn` to specify source paths, dependency JARS, aliases, _etc_. just as you can with `clj` or `clojure`.

If you do

```
plk -h
```

you will see that the `plk` script accepts the same arguments as the `clj` / `clojure` tools, along with the additional arguments supported by `planck`.

So for example, to put Andare 0.9.0 and `test.check` 0.10.0-alpha3 on your classpath (automatically downloading them if necessary), just place a  `deps.edn` like the following in the directory where you launch `plk`:

```clojure
{:deps {andare {:mvn/version "0.9.0"}
        org.clojure/test.check {:mvn/version "0.10.0-alpha3"}}}
```

#### Shebang Deps

If you'd like to specify `deps.edn` dependencies directly within a `#!` script, this is possible by making use of `bash` and `exec`, as is done in the following example:

```clojure
#!/usr/bin/env bash
"exec" "plk" "-Sdeps" "{:deps {andare {:mvn/version \"0.9.0\"}}}" "-Ksf" "$0" "$@"
(require '[clojure.core.async :refer [chan go <! >!]])

(def c (chan))
(go (prn (<! c)))
(go (>! c *command-line-args*))
```

This stand-alone script specifies its own dependencies (via the `-Sdeps` _dep-opt_), while also passing _init-opts_ to `plk` (prior to `"$0"`, which is the path to the script, and thus the _main-opt_), along with , any command-line args following the _main-opt_ via `"$@"`.

> Also note that the script both a valid Bash script (as the `exec` causes the script to terminate prior to any ClojureScript text being parsed), and a valid ClojureScript file (all of the values on `"exec"` line are ClojureScript strings and thus harmless values preceding the `require` form).

### Using Boot

The [Boot](https://boot-clj.com/) build tool can be used to generate a classpath file that can be fed into Planck. A side effect of creating such a file is that Boot will also download the specified dependencies (see "Downloading Deps" below).

Let's look at an example that puts the [cljs-time](https://clojars.org/com.andrewmcveigh/cljs-time) library on the classpath. On a system with `boot` installed, run the following:

```sh
boot -d com.andrewmcveigh/cljs-time:"0.5.2" with-cp -w --file .classpath
```

The list of dependencies (one in this case) is written to `.classpath`. You can use this file in invocations of `planck` like so:

```sh
planck -c `cat .classpath` 
```

### Classpath Specification

Planck's classpath can be directly specified by providing a colon-separated list of directories and/or JARs via the `-c` / `-​-​classpath` argument, or by the `PLANCK_CLASSPATH` environment variable.
For example,

```sh
planck -c src:/path/to/foo.jar:some-lib/src
```

will cause Planck to search in the `src` directory first, then in `foo.jar` next, and finally `some-lib/src` for files when processing `require`, `require-macros`, `import`, and `ns` forms.

### Abbreviated Dependency Specs

The `-D` / `-​-​dependencies` option can be used to specify coordinates for JARs installed in your local `.m2` repo: You can provide a comma separated list of `SYM:VERSION`, and paths to these JARs will be appended to your classpath.

For example,

```sh
planck -c src -D andare:0.9.0,org.clojure/test.check:0.10.0-alpha3
```

will expand to a classpath that specifies `src` followed by the paths to the Andare and `test.check` dependencies in your local `.m2` repository.

In order to use an explicitly-specified path to a Maven repository, you can additionally include `-L` or `-​-​local-repo`, specifying the repository path.

### Downloading Deps

While `planck` can consume JARs from your local `.m2` repo, it doesn't take care of downloading them. (An alternative is to use `plk` and `deps.edn`, which delegates to `clojure` for deps download.) 

An easy way to quickly download dependencies is to use [`boot`](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot) with its `-d` option. For example, executing this will ensure the dependencies specified above are installed:

```
boot -d andare:0.9.0 -d org.clojure/test.check:0.10.0-alpha3
```

### Bundled Deps

Planck ships with many of the deps that are available to conventional ClojureScript code. In particular this includes [the majority of the Google Closure Library](https://cljdoc.org/d/planck/planck/CURRENT/doc/gcl) as well as these namespaces:

* `cljs.test`
* `clojure.core.reducers`
* `clojure.data`
* `clojure.template`
* `clojure.string`
* `clojure.set`
* `clojure.walk`
* `clojure.zip`

In addition, Planck ships with these libraries:

* [Fipp](https://github.com/brandonbloom/fipp) 0.6.18
* [test.check](https://github.com/clojure/test.check) 1.1.1
* [transit-cljs](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-cljs) 0.8.256
* [transit-js](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-js) 0.8.861

Note that bundled dependencies, which includes the core ClojureScript compiler namespaces, are loaded in preference to dependencies specified via `deps.edn`, `-c` / `-​-​classpath`, `-D` / `-​-​dependencies`, or `PLANCK_CLASSPATH`.

A consequence of this (as well as the fact that nearly all of the code that ships with Planck is AOT-compiled), means that Planck works with a fixed version of ClojureScript. (It is not possible to update the ClojureScript version by providing a path to a newer version via `deps.edn`, `-c` / `-​-​classpath`, `-D` / `-​-​dependencies`, or `PLANCK_CLASSPATH`.)

### Foreign Libs

It is possible to use foreign libraries with Planck.

> “Foreign” libraries are implemented in a language that is not ClojureScript. (In other words, JavaScript!)

Foreign libs are specified using a [`:foreign-libs` specification](https://clojurescript.org/reference/compiler-options#foreign-libs) which indicates the synthetic namespace, the JavaScript file that needs to be loaded, any global exports, and an indication of any other dependencies that need to be loaded for each foreign lib.

The `:foreign-libs` specification can be passed via `-co` / `--compile-opts`, or can be specified in any `deps.cljs` files on the classpath (including those embedded in a JAR file). 

If specified for a given foreign lib, Planck will load `:file-min` in preference to `:file` if Planck is launched with `simple` optimizations (via `-O simple` or `--optimizations simple`).

One easy way to make use of foreign libs packaged in this manner is via the excellent [CLJSJS](http://cljsjs.github.io) project. While many of the libraries packaged by CLJSJS cannot work with Planck because they either require a browser environment or Node, some utility libraries work just fine.

Here's an example: Let's say you want to use the [long.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/long.js) library. 

If you launch Planck wtih 

```
plk -Sdeps '{:deps {cljsjs/long {:mvn/version "3.0.3-1"}}}'
```

you can `(require 'cljsjs.long)` to load the library and then proceed to use it using ClojureScript's JavaScript interop capabilities:

```clojure-repl
cljs.user=> (require 'cljsjs.long)
nil
cljs.user=> (str (js/Long. 0xFFFFFFFF 0x7FFFFFFF))
"9223372036854775807"
cljs.user=> (str js/Long.MAX_UNSIGNED_VALUE)
"18446744073709551615"
```
